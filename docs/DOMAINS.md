# Sentinel — Domain Model

## Entities

### Test
The central entity. Represents a user-defined monitoring check.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` (nanoid) | Unique identifier |
| `name` | `string` | Human-readable label |
| `code` | `string` | JavaScript function body — must return boolean |
| `schedule_ms` | `number` | Run interval in milliseconds (minimum: 30,000) |
| `timeout_ms` | `number` | Max execution time per run (minimum: 1,000; must be ≤ 80% of `schedule_ms`) |
| `retries` | `number` | Reserved retry budget per check (currently not applied by executor; each scheduled run records a single final outcome) |
| `uses_browser` | `boolean` | Whether this test uses Playwright (opt-in, default false) |
| `enabled` | `boolean` | Whether the scheduler should run this test |
| `created_at` | `timestamp` | Creation time |
| `updated_at` | `timestamp` | Last modification time |

**Invariants:**
- `schedule_ms >= 30000` — minimum 30-second interval
- `timeout_ms >= 1000` and `timeout_ms <= schedule_ms * 0.8` — no flat cap, but a run's timeout budget may never approach its own interval, so the scheduler can't end up with two overlapping runs of the same test (enforced in the Zod schema on create, and as a Postgres `CHECK` constraint on both create and update — see `apps/api/src/scheduler/index.ts` for the runtime overlap guard that backs this up)
- `code` must compile without error before saving
- `code` must be a function body that returns a boolean

---

### TestRun
A single execution result for a test.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` (nanoid) | Unique identifier |
| `test_id` | `string` | FK → Test |
| `started_at` | `timestamp` | Execution start time |
| `finished_at` | `timestamp` | Execution end time |
| `status` | `'success' \| 'warn' \| 'fail' \| 'timeout'` | Outcome |
| `duration_ms` | `number` | Wall-clock execution duration |
| `error_message` | `string \| null` | Error/warning details if status is warn, fail, or timeout |

**Invariants:**
- `finished_at >= started_at`
- `status = 'warn'` when the test called `ctx.warn()` without throwing — `error_message` holds the joined warning messages
- `status = 'timeout'` when execution exceeded `test.timeout_ms`
- Raw runs are retained for 7 days by default (`RAW_RETENTION_DAYS`) and pruned daily by timestamp cutoff in batches

---

### AssertionResult
An individual named assertion within a test run. Optional — only recorded when user code calls `ctx.assert()`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` (nanoid) | Unique identifier |
| `test_run_id` | `string` | FK → TestRun |
| `test_run_started_at` | `timestamp` | Partition key companion for FK → TestRun |
| `name` | `string` | Assertion label (e.g., "status is 200") |
| `passed` | `boolean` | Whether the assertion passed |
| `message` | `string \| null` | Failure reason or additional context |

**Invariants:**
- `(test_run_id, test_run_started_at)` references `TestRun(id, started_at)` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`
- Assertion rows are pruned automatically when retained raw runs are deleted

---

### UptimeDaily
Pre-aggregated daily stats per test. The only table queried by public dashboards.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `test_id` | `string` | FK → Test |
| `date` | `date` (YYYY-MM-DD) | The day this row covers |
| `success_count` | `number` | Successful runs that day |
| `failure_count` | `number` | Failed + timeout runs that day |
| `avg_latency_ms` | `number` | Average duration across all runs that day |

**Invariants:**
- One row per (test_id, date) — upserted at end of day
- Retained for 30–180 days via config (`AGG_RETENTION_DAYS`, default 90)
- Never queried alongside raw `test_runs` — used exclusively for history/dashboard

---

### Secret
A named, encrypted-at-rest value referenced in test code as `ctx.secrets.NAME`. Global — not scoped to a `Test`, no relationship to any other entity.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `id` | `string` (nanoid) | Unique identifier |
| `name` | `string` | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` — this is the literal `ctx.secrets` property key |
| `value_blob` | `bytea` | Version-tagged blob: AES-256-GCM ciphertext if `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` was set at write time, plaintext otherwise. Never exposed via the API or shared types |
| `created_at` | `timestamp` | Creation time |
| `updated_at` | `timestamp` | Last rotation time |

**Invariants:**
- `name` is `UNIQUE` and must match `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*$` (enforced by both a Zod schema and a Postgres `CHECK` constraint)
- **Write-only**: no API response ever includes the decrypted value or `value_blob` after creation — only `create` (initial value), `rotate` (replace value), `delete`, and `list`/`status` (metadata only) are exposed
- `name` is immutable — renaming would silently break any test code referencing `ctx.secrets.NAME`; changing a value means rotating it, not editing the row
- Encryption is optional: if `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is unset when a secret is created or rotated, its `value_blob` stays in plaintext (mode-tagged) form; encrypted and plaintext secrets can coexist in the table
- A secret whose `value_blob` can't be decrypted by the running process (e.g. the key was changed or removed after that secret was encrypted) is logged and excluded from `ctx.secrets` rather than crashing the process — see `apps/api/src/db/queries/secrets.ts`

---

### NotificationChannel
A named, global delivery target for alerts. Not scoped to a `Test` directly — attached via `ChannelAssignment`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` (nanoid) | Unique identifier |
| `name` | `string` | Human-readable label |
| `type` | `'discord' \| 'slack' \| 'webhook' \| 'email'` | Channel type |
| `webhook_url` | `string \| null` | Target URL — required for `discord`/`slack`/`webhook` |
| `email_to` | `string[] \| null` | Recipient addresses — required for `email` |
| `enabled` | `boolean` | Whether this channel is active |

**Invariants:**
- `webhook_url` must be a valid HTTPS URL when set
- `type = 'email'` requires a non-empty `email_to`; every other type requires `webhook_url`
- A channel is global — it must be attached to a `Test` or a tag via `ChannelAssignment` before it receives anything

---

### ChannelAssignment
Attaches a `NotificationChannel` to a `Test` (directly) or to a tag (inherited by every test with that tag), and filters which notification event types that attachment fires on. Backed by the `channel_assignments` table.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `channel_id` | `string` | FK → NotificationChannel |
| `scope_type` | `'test' \| 'tag'` | Whether `scope_value` is a `Test.id` or a tag string |
| `scope_value` | `string` | The `Test.id` or tag being targeted |
| `event_types` | `('fail' \| 'warning' \| 'recovery')[]` | Which notification events this assignment fires on |

**Invariants:**
- Primary key is `(channel_id, scope_type, scope_value)` — one assignment per channel per scope
- `event_types` must be non-empty and drawn only from `'fail' | 'warning' | 'recovery'`; defaults to all three (existing behavior) when not narrowed
- A channel fires for a given test/event if **any** assignment matching that test — whether `scope_type = 'test'` directly, or `scope_type = 'tag'` via one of the test's tags — includes that event type. This lets a single test route, say, `warning` to one channel and `fail` to another without needing separate tests per event type.

---

### TestState
Runtime state for each test. Tracks alert logic. Persisted to DB but treated as a live cache in memory.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `test_id` | `string` | FK → Test (PK) |
| `last_status` | `'success' \| 'warn' \| 'fail' \| 'timeout' \| null` | Status of the most recent run |
| `consecutive_failures` | `number` | Unbroken streak of non-success, non-warn results |
| `last_notification_at` | `timestamp \| null` | When the last fail/recovery alert was fired |
| `last_warning_at` | `timestamp \| null` | When the last warning alert was fired |
| `last_run_at` | `timestamp \| null` | When the test last executed |

**Invariants:**
- `consecutive_failures` resets to 0 on `success` or `warn` (neither is a failure streak)
- A **fail** notification fires when `consecutive_failures >= threshold` AND `now - last_notification_at > cooldown`
- A **warning** notification fires on the first `warn` result (no threshold), then after `cooldown` elapses — tracked independently via `last_warning_at` so it never blocks a subsequent fail alert
- A **recovery** notification fires on `success` if either `last_notification_at` or `last_warning_at` is set; both are cleared on recovery

---

## Relationships

```
Test (1) ──────────────────────→ (M) TestRun
Test (1) ──────────────────────→ (M) ChannelAssignment (scope_type='test')
Test (1) ──────────────────────→ (1) TestState
Test (1) ──────────────────────→ (M) UptimeDaily
TestRun (1) ───────────────────→ (M) AssertionResult
NotificationChannel (1) ───────→ (M) ChannelAssignment

ChannelAssignment.scope_value also matches tags (scope_type='tag'), which is a
loose reference against Test.tags rather than a foreign key — a channel
assigned to a tag applies to every Test carrying that tag.

Secret is global and unrelated to any other entity — every Test can read every
Secret via ctx.secrets, there is no join table.
```

## `ctx` API (Test Execution Context)

The object passed to user test functions. This is the only interface user code has with the outside world.

```typescript
interface TestContext {
  http: {
    get(url: string, options?: RequestOptions): Promise<HttpResponse>
    post(url: string, body: unknown, options?: RequestOptions): Promise<HttpResponse>
  }
  ftp: {
    ls(url: string, options?: FtpOptions): Promise<FtpEntry[]>
    get(url: string, options?: FtpOptions): Promise<FtpDownloadResult>
  }
  s3: {
    get(url: string, options: S3Options): Promise<HttpResponse>
    head(url: string, options: S3Options): Promise<HttpResponse>
  }
  assert: (name: string, value: boolean, message?: string) => void
  warn: (message: string) => void
  log: (message: string) => void
  now: () => Date
  secrets: Readonly<Record<string, string>>
}

interface HttpResponse {
  status: number
  headers: Record<string, string>
  body: string
  json<T = unknown>(): T
  duration_ms: number
}

interface RequestOptions {
  headers?: Record<string, string>
  timeout?: number
  redirect?: 'follow' | 'manual' | 'error'
}

interface FtpEntry {
  name: string
  type: 'file' | 'directory' | 'unknown'
  size: number
  modifiedAt: Date | null
}

interface FtpDownloadResult {
  body: string
  size: number
}

interface FtpOptions {
  user?: string
  password?: string
  secure?: boolean   // FTPS (explicit TLS), default false
  timeout?: number    // per-connection socket timeout, ms
}

interface S3Options {
  accessKey: string
  secretKey: string
  region: string
  sessionToken?: string           // for temporary/STS credentials
  headers?: Record<string, string> // extra headers (e.g. Range) — included in the SigV4 signature
}
```

**Method behaviour:**
- `ctx.assert(name, value, message?)` — records a named assertion; throws immediately on failure, failing the run
- `ctx.warn(message)` — records a warning message and emits it to the run log; does **not** throw; if any warns were recorded when the test returns, status becomes `'warn'` and `error_message` holds all messages joined by `'; '`
- `ctx.log(message)` — emits a message to the run log; has no effect on status
- `ctx.http` routes through undici with the test's timeout enforced
- `ctx.ftp.ls`/`ctx.ftp.get` route through `basic-ftp`; `url` is a full `ftp://[user:pass@]host[:port]/path`. `get` downloads to a server-managed temp file (`FTP_TEMP_DIR`), reads it into `body`, and deletes it before returning — the file never outlives the call. Downloads are capped by `FTP_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES` (default 5MB) and aborted if exceeded. A periodic sweep job deletes any orphaned temp file older than `FTP_TEMP_MAX_AGE_MS` as a backstop for crash/timeout edge cases. User code never sees a file path — only the returned string body.
- `ctx.s3.get`/`ctx.s3.head` sign the request with AWS Signature Version 4, hand-rolled with `node:crypto` (no AWS SDK — see Approved Dependencies) using the supplied `accessKey`/`secretKey`/`region` (and `sessionToken` if given). `url` is the full object URL — virtual-hosted-style (`https://bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/key`), path-style, or any S3-compatible endpoint (MinIO, R2, etc.) all work the same way since signing is derived entirely from the URL's host/path/query. `options.headers` (e.g. `Range`) are included in the signature. `ctx.s3.head` has no response body and routes through the same in-memory undici client as `ctx.http`. `ctx.s3.get` downloads through the *same* server-managed temp file mechanism as `ctx.ftp.get` — same directory (`FTP_TEMP_DIR`), same size cap (`FTP_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES`), same periodic sweep backstop (`FTP_TEMP_MAX_AGE_MS`) — rather than buffering the object in memory; the file is deleted before returning, and user code never sees a path, only the returned string `body`. Both methods return the same `HttpResponse` shape as `ctx.http`. Failures throw `S3RequestError` with `code: 'S3_SIGNING_ERROR'` (malformed URL, thrown before any network call), `code: 'S3_FETCH_ERROR'` (the underlying request failed), or, for `get`, `code: 'S3_SIZE_LIMIT_ERROR'` (download exceeded `FTP_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES`, aborted mid-transfer).
- `ctx.secrets` is a plain, frozen object (not a getter/method) mapping every `Secret.name` to its decrypted value — accessing a name that doesn't exist yields `undefined`, same as any missing object property; it never throws. It's backed by an in-memory cache (`apps/api/src/executor/secrets-cache.ts`) decrypted once at process startup and refreshed synchronously on every secret create/rotate/delete, so building `ctx` never queries the database or does crypto on the test-execution hot path.
- No `ctx.fs`, no `ctx.exec`, no `require()`, no `import`
